            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

After ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall dayes marching; on thur≈øday night la≈øt about ≈øeven of the Clock wee faced the Kings body at Cropready bridge neare Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, and all day, the next day, and ye≈øterday till noone being Saturday, about ten of the clock in the forenoone wee di≈øcovered their Army to be upon the march towards <hi>Daintry:</hi> and as ≈øome (who were ≈øince taken pri≈øoners) affirme, their entent was from thence to <hi>York:</hi> Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on command was given to ≈øome particular per≈øons to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance after them, and fall in their Reere: But it proved the middle of their whole body.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:155226:3"/>
According to the order, our Regiment of Hor≈øe and Collonell <hi>Vandro≈ø≈øes,</hi> advanced under the Command of Lievtenant Generall <hi>Middleton,</hi> and Captain <hi>Butler,</hi> Adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Generall, and foure Companies of <hi>Farnbam</hi> foote, and five Companies of Sir <hi>Williams</hi> owne Regiment, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of Lievtenant Collonell <hi>Baines,</hi> (≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time a Brewer in <hi>London)</hi> Quarter-Ma≈øter Generall to the foote.</p>
            <p>They had placed a Guard to ≈øecure <hi>Cropready</hi>-bridge, which wee readily beat off, and made the bridge our owne by a partie of Dragoons, and pa≈øt over the River between us and <hi>Banbury,</hi> (for till then we were on the one ≈øide of the River, and they on the other) being over the River, through mi≈ø-information, wee too ≈øpeedily pur≈øued the enemy, (being enformed that their whole bodie was marched away, when as a third part of them were left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde unknowne to us. Wee pur≈øued them above a mile, till we came to a bridge, where their Foot made a ≈øtand, drew up and fac'd us; wee being within Musket ≈øhot of them, onely our foure elde≈øt Troops, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Sir <hi>Arthurs,</hi> Captaine <hi>Okees;</hi> Captaine <hi>Foleyes,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:</hi> They overthrew a Carriage to barricado the bridge, and planted it with Muskettiers. This occa≈øioned our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat back againe, being unwilling too farre to engage our ≈øelves, having no Foot within above halfe a mile of us, and di≈øcovering their Army behind us, upon our retreat wee di≈øcovered the party of Foot (drawne over with us) by an unre≈øi≈øtable body of the enemies Hor≈øe, of ≈øome thirty Troops, and two regiments of Foot put to di≈øorderly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, which ha≈øtened our march back againe, and comming back we found the way to the bridge within a quarter of a mile, ≈øtopt with the enemies Hor≈øe and Foot, who were got between our Foot and the bridge: For who≈øe reliefe (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our way backe lay on the right hand, we advanced up to their body on the left hand up the hill, and with our foure Troops charged the Kings owne Regiment, and put
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:155226:3"/>
them to a retreat; but the other Troop commming downe upon us, (there being of them in all ≈øome three Regiments) with whom we were in no ca≈øe able to deale, we were nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øitated to retreat very di≈øorderly, having put their body of Hor≈øe into a combu≈øtion, having ≈ølain three Colonels, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one was Sir <hi>William Butler,</hi> a Papi≈øt of <hi>Kent,</hi> Lieutenant generall of Hor≈øe <hi>(viz.) Wilmut</hi> was ≈øore wounded, and his Lieutenant Generall taken pri≈øoner, and committed to the cu≈øtody of two Souldiers, who in our di≈øorderly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat lo≈øt him againe: We ≈ølue divers other of their Officers both in our charge and in our retreat, the way being fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with their foot and hor≈øe, many whereof were woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ≈øorely, ≈ølew others, and took ≈øome pri≈øoners. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming back to the Bridge, the Hamblets very honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and ≈øtoutly made good the Bridge, kept back the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and recovered three peeces of our Ordnance, which we had lo≈øt; we having lo≈øt ≈øome half a dozen ≈ømall peeces be≈øides, which were unadvi≈øedly drawne over before the Foot were ready to march along with them, and the men running a way with the hor≈øe, we could not draw them back again: being over th bridge, we rallied together, and drew our body toward anoher place of the river, where the enemy made ≈øhew of comming over, but we kept them on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øide; although we could not attain what we attempted, yet we hereby bravely cau≈øed them to draw back their whol body from their march onward toward <hi>Daintry,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> mu≈øt retard their journy to <hi>York.</hi> Having faced them ≈øeveral hours together, towards evening the King ≈øent his trumpeter to our General, w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> a me≈ø≈øage to this effect, that if our General plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, he would ≈øend a Herald of Armes, which at the head of our Army ≈øhould proclaim a gracious Me≈ø≈øage. The an≈øwer from our Generall was returned thus, That he had no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion to treat with his Maje≈øtie concerning peace; but if he plea≈øed to ≈øend to the two Hou≈øes of Parliament, wee ≈øhould remain his faithfull ≈øubjects. In the time of our facing wee exchanged ≈øeverall Cannon ≈øhot, as we conceive fourty ≈øhot apiece, but through Gods mercy, all their Cannon ≈øhot gave
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:155226:4"/>
us but the lo≈ø≈øe of one hor≈øe, not one man; but our ≈øhot, the Lord ≈øo ordering it, cau≈øed them to draw backe their body out of our reach, where they abode all night. Wee tooke in the fight two Hor≈øe Colours of theirs, and we lo≈øt three Foot Colours, we have lo≈øt Lievtenant Colonell <hi>Baines,</hi> who as we heare, would not take quarter, we have lo≈øt Col. <hi>Wembs,</hi> Collonell of our Artillery, and Lievtenant Collonell <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> Lievtenant Collonell to Sir <hi>Williams</hi> Regiment of foote.</p>
            <p>Wee have lo≈øt of ours, and taken pri≈øoners neare upon one hundred, or ≈øix ≈øcore. Captaine <hi>Okes</hi> has lo≈øt ≈øome ten men, whereof one Ma≈øter <hi>Cre≈øey</hi> it one: Captain <hi>Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> hath lo≈øt neer as many: Captain <hi>Foleys</hi> foure, and three wounded, whereof one <hi>Thomas Steme,</hi> an apprenti≈øe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly to Ma≈øter <hi>Lloyd,</hi> who lived in Watling-≈øtreet is one, being ≈øhot into the thigh, the thigh-bone broke, and run through both buttocks with a tuck: We this day ≈øent him and another, one <hi>John Nicklis</hi> to <hi>Warwicke,</hi> there to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully provided for. We have lo≈øt but one Officer in all our Regiment, prai≈øed be God, and that is Captain <hi>Perries</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net.</p>
            <p>It was an infinite mercy of God we had not been all lo≈øt, which we de≈øire may bee taken notice of, with ≈øolemne thankes to God almightie, who was our onely helper: as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo for the double good effect it wrought; <hi>viz.</hi> it drew their body back from marching toward <hi>York;</hi> and wee relieved ≈øome ≈øix hundred hor≈øe that were comming to joyne with us, whom the enemy had faced above a quarter of an houre, comming from <hi>Northampton,</hi> who had not wee take this cour≈øe, in all probabilitie they had been all cut off. Wee have taken a Major of the Kings owne Regiment, his name is <hi>Webbe,</hi> he is mortally wounded, not likely to recover: Our Officers and Souldiers are very well, and very cheerefull, willingly content to goe on with the work, if we can but be ≈øupplyed with bread and water, our lodging having for ≈øeverall nights been, and ≈øtill is, on Gods cold earth, over-≈øhaddowed with the Canopie of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:155226:4"/>
heavens ≈øweet Firmament, and God in much mercy hath afforded us ≈øweet temperate weather; nothing hath been ≈øo ≈øhort with us as Bread for men, the earth afford ng gra≈ø≈øe for our hor≈øes. Wee ≈øtill continue facing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the River between us, wee maintain <hi>Cropready-bridge,</hi> and hinder their pa≈ø≈øage over to us, waiting what they will do, and expecting further ≈øupplyes, either from Col. <hi>Brown,</hi> Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> Collonel <hi>Murey,</hi> or the Earle of <hi>Denbigh,</hi> whom it plea≈øes God to ≈øend. They have a far larger bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of hor≈øe then wee, but for foot wee dare incounter, being no ways fearfull to deal with their hor≈øe.</p>
            <p>Wee de≈øire not to bury the mercies of God in obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion, but to tell of his loving kindne≈ø≈øe, and de≈øire that all our friends may be acquainted with his goodne≈ø≈øe to us in this delivery, that they may be the better ≈øtirred up, both in publique and private to ble≈ø≈øe God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with us.</p>
            <p>We de≈øire your prayers for our good ≈øucce≈ø≈øe, and that is the greate≈øt comfort that under God wee have, that wee have a ≈øtock of prayers ≈øtill going on among all Gods people. His Maje≈øty was under a tree in the field not above Pi≈øtoll<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>≈øhot where wee charged his hor≈øe, as ≈øome of our own men, and ≈øome of their pri≈øoners af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm. Wee have about 80. of theirs pri≈øoners; there is now another Trumpeter come from his Maje≈øty, but for what we know not, it is ≈øure no parley, for our Cannon playes at them. My Capt. man, <hi>Henry Philips</hi> the Barbar is taken pri≈øoner: my man <hi>Thomas Suger</hi> charged with mee, and came off, ble≈ø≈øed be God, ≈øafe and well, and did good ≈øervice.</p>
            <p>All our Officers and Souldiers in this bu≈øine≈ø≈øe beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them≈øelves very ≈øtoutly. Lievtenant Generall <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and Adjutant Generall <hi>Butler,</hi> charged with us very gallantly; Lievtenant Generall <hi>Middleton</hi> was acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally di≈ømounted, and one of Captain <hi>Okes</hi> his men di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, and mounted him on his hor≈øe, and after brought off the Lievetenant Generalls owne hor≈øe and pi≈øtols,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:155226:5"/>
for which the Lievtenant Generall hath made him a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Lievtenant, and he ≈øhall be his childe ≈øo long as he lives. I fear the Po≈øt will be gone, I take leave, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand times farewell, the Lord pre≈øerve you and us all, which is the de≈øire of thy truly loving Brother till death,</p>
